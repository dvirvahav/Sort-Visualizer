# Sort-Visualizer
Visual the most common sorting algorithms.
Was developed as part of my self-project to expend JAVA-GUI knowledge.
The app has control panel with option to : choose sorting algorithm, start,stop,shuffle,speed and arraySize.
You can choose sorting algorithm, stop it and choose another sorting algorithm to continute sorting without array reset.
Speed is automatically continues sorting after speed change.


Enjoy!

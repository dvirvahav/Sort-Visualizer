# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This application provides a dynamic visualization of the most common sorting algorithms. It was developed as part of a personal project to expand my JAVA-GUI expertise.

The application includes a control panel that allows you to:

- Select a sorting algorithm
- Start, stop, and shuffle the sorting process
- Adjust the speed of the visualization
- Alter the size of the array being sorted

One of the key features is the ability to stop a sorting process, select a different sorting algorithm, and continue sorting without resetting the array. Additionally, the sorting process automatically resumes after any speed adjustment.
